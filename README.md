## Deployment

To use this extension, you will have to install it on your chrome browser : when you are in the extensions menu, activate the developper mode, and then you'll will be able to load the local files form the repo.
It won't work if you load it as a regular webpage.
You will also need to put in your own API keys (and replace the "*** You API Key ..."). The API source is specified. 3 keys are required (content.js, quote.js and weather.js)
